# NutriBase
NutriBase enables users to set their own nutritional goals, then assemble meals from food profiles from the [USDA Food Composition Databases](https://ndb.nal.usda.gov/ndb/) which enables them to track their progress for the day and over time.  The project is still in development.

## User Experience

### Signup/Signin
When you first hit the app you are given a simple sign-up/sign-in form.

### Edit Profile
If you are a new user and the form is valid, you are redirected to the Edit Profile page where you can set up your diet profile.

### Dashboard
After you have chosen your profile or login as a user, you are taken to the Dashboard where you can create meals and see where you are in your intake for the day.

### Adding a Meal
From the dashboard view, you can add a meal and add foods to that meal.

## Future Plans
This is an ongoing project, and there are several features and changes to come:
* add a food search from the USDA database to add to ours
* create the ability to view line graphs for the user's performance over an arbitrary number of days
* convert the front-end to an Angular application
* possibly more metrics
